	<br>To be honest, the subject of this course is actually easy to understand

	<br>I studied here for 6 years. I think my primary school is one of 
	<br>the best primary school out there because it combines academic
	<br>subject with religious subject in one school. Therefore, I got the
	<br>opportunity to learn both aspects when I was little.  
	<br>My primary school days is one of the good old day
